competition pages. Our team also works on a logical flow of the site. Then, the
website design and graphics production would be the next step. Finally, it will be

April 26, 2023; team decided to start the process with the least features and
gradually identify more advanced options then gather them into the platform to
structure popularity and vital options of all famous social networks.
